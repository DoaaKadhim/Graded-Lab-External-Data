# Project README

## Overview

This project involves building an interactive web application that fetches and displays data from an external API. You will use `fetch` and `Axios` for data retrieval and management. The application should dynamically update based on the API responses, with full support for asynchronous operations.

## Objectives

- **Data Retrieval:** Implement functionality to request data from an external API using both `fetch` and `Axios`.
- **Interactive Webpage:** Develop a dynamic webpage that fetches and displays content from the API. The interface should be interactive and update in real-time based on user actions.
- **Asynchronous Operations:** Use `async/await` and Promises to handle asynchronous data requests and manage responses in a synchronous manner.
- **Data Management:** Implement functionality to send and remove data from the external API using `fetch` or `Axios`. This includes handling POST and DELETE requests.

## Tasks

1. **Data Retrieval with `fetch` and `Axios`:**
   - Create functions to retrieve data from the API using `fetch` and `Axios`.
   - Ensure that data is fetched correctly and handled appropriately in the application.

2. **Dynamic Webpage Creation:**
   - Build a dynamic webpage that updates based on the fetched data.
   - Ensure that the webpage is interactive and provides a seamless user experience.

3. **Asynchronous Logic:**
   - Use `async/await` and Promises to manage asynchronous actions.
   - Ensure that asynchronous operations are handled in a way that maintains synchronous logic flow.

4. **Data Management (POST and DELETE):**
   - Implement functionality to send data to the API (POST requests) and remove data from the API (DELETE requests).
   - Ensure that data management operations are performed correctly and reflect in the application.
